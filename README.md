# A-star search

This is an implementation of the A-star graph search in java. 

The implementation contains an A-star implementation, as well as implementations of a few different heuristic functions that can be used.

We've also created a test class + test files, manifested as [rush hour puzzles] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)). After compiling the code, you can test out  by running, in the terminal:

`java RushHour jams.txt`

You should see the rush hour puzzles being solved!
